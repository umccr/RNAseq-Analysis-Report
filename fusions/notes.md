# Introduction

Gene fusions are hybrid genes formed when two previously independent genes become juxtaposed. The fusion can result from structural rearrangements like translocations and deletions, transcription read-through of neighboring genes, or the trans- and cis-splicing of pre-mRNAs [ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4889949/).

Many gene fusions are associated with oncogenic properties, and often act as driver mutations in a wide array of cancer types.

## RNA-seq report structure

Work in progress...


The **`Mutated genes`**, **`Structural variants`** and **`CN altered genes`** sections will contain information about expression levels of the mutated genes, genes located within detected structural variants (SVs) and copy-number (CN) altered regions, respectively. Genes will be ordered by increasing *variants* `TIER`, *SV* `score` and `CN` *value*, resepctively, and then by decreasing absolute values in the `Patient` vs selected `dataset` column. Moreover, gene fusions detected in WTS data and reported in **`Fusion genes`** section will be first ordered based on the evidence from genome-based data (`DNA support (gene A/B)` columns).

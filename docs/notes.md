#Introduction#

This document records notes and links to papers and repositories, we *think* are interesting or worth exploring/incorporating into UMCCR RNAseq analysis report.

Not to forget, another Google-doc created before is [RNAseq-Workflows](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WqQQiDgVMIrm856xdNAdqGQibHWUIFx5Ir0xzB8pOEE/edit#heading=h.mh989jx06fxl).

##https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq##

nfcore/rnaseq is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for RNA sequencing data, built using Nextflow.

Copying a message from slack (Oliver's).

I didn't see anything that I wanted to incorporate -- it's a good, best practice workflow. I _did_ want to look at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/dupRadar.html again as it's written by an old PhD friend of mine. I also still have to check if they ship variant sites for use with HiSat2 which we could adopt.

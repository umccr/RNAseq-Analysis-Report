### To-do list

* [Cumulative distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function) (CDF) plots for selected genes to present their expression levels in the context of the overall expression distribution in investigated sample
* Link to [umccrise](https://github.com/umccr/umccrise) report to define genes to for the  CDF plots

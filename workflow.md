### Fusion genes detection

All [fusions](./fusions) listed in the unfiltered [pizzly](https://github.com/pmelsted/pizzly) output file (see example [test_sample_WTS-flat.tsv](./data/test_data/final/test_sample_WTS/pizzly/test_sample_WTS-flat.tsv)) are reported since it was noted that some genuine fusions (based on WGS data and curation efforts) are excluded in the filtered [pizzly](https://github.com/pmelsted/pizzly) output file. If WGS results from **[umccrise](https://github.com/umccr/umccrise)** are available then fusion genes in the **`Fusion genes`** section are ordered based on the evidence from genome-based data.
